Pragyan’13 presents Allumette, a rare opportunity to collaborate your academic brilliance with real life problem statement directly applicable in the industrial scenario.  This event aims to be a strong platform for budding engineers to exhibit their innate talents and practical viewpoints in the process of acquiring an innovative solution for the given situation. Potassium Chlorate is the main ingredient in “Match head composition”.  In powder form, it is highly susceptible to moisture absorption from the atmosphere.  This triggers the tendency to form lump-like deposits which gradually get hardened with the passage of time.  This eventually slows down the overall process as unnecessary labor is required to remove these deposits to make Potassium Chlorate free-flowing. And now, the challenge is to propose a technically sound, economically viable and well-engineered solution to manufacture free-flowing Potassium Chlorate.

“Viridis Postremo” - Pragyan'13 is back with the punch to defend our nature!!  Here is providing a platform for the GREEN engineer in you, with the sole purpose of solving real environmental oriented problem faced by the industries. 
Chromium, used in the manufacturing process of Potassium Chlorate, when present in large quantities and in different forms is toxic.  Hence, the waste sludge that contains Chromium needs the right treatment to bring down the toxicity level.
Come up with an innovative solution to tackle the danger caused by untreated effluents being dumped directly into open environment and thereby, lessen the burden that nature already faces.
GET GEARED!! GET TECH!! GET GREEN!!

“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”
                              -Leonardo da Vinci
 
And indeed it is. Simplicity is the law of the world. But for those who think defying the laws is awesome and creating awe is passion, Welcome ! We want you to think, rethink, conquer the boundaries of your imagination to defy all that logic and make the Mundane, Insane!! Take the task, fiddle with the laws, and get ready to blow minds!! The more the complexity, the more you earn!!
 
Here at Contraptions we truly believe that science is not meant to be taught in boring, confined boxes, but unleashed and experimented with -and this alone reflects its true mastery.
 
Throw in all the energy conversions you are aware of as one continuous routine without physically engaging yourself at any stage (Aaah yes that's the real challenge).
 
So, ladies and gentlemen, get ready for showcasing your wildest and most complex solutions.

- The entire contraption to include should remain completely within an Square whose dimensions are 4m x 4m  at any point of operation.
     
- Once the first step has been initiated, intervention of any sort in the following steps would lead to deduction in points.
     
- An initial setup time of 180 minutes will be given for each team. In addition to this, a setup time of 10 minutes will be given for every team before each trial. Moreover, points will be deducted for consecutive trials.
     
- Maximum of 3 trials would be allowed for each team.
     
- The total trial time (including setup time) taken for task should not exceed 20 minutes.
     
- 220 volts AC supply would be provided at the event venue.
     
- Teams may use commercially available machines as individual parts of your contraption. Any questionable items must be given prior consent by the event manager. If you have any special requirements inform us well in advance. It will be taken care of. Extension cords, scissors, tape etc. will be provided.
     
- A step is defined as an action that results in another action working towards the final aim of the machine. For example the act of tipping over of block of wood with a rolling ball is a step. The actual tipping motion of the block is not a step unless it causes another action to occur. A series of the same actions repeated such as dominoes knocking each other over or a ball hitting another ball are considered to be one step in the spirit of the competition.
     
- A parallel step is defined as an action which initiates multiple smaller steps, starting and ending at the same point, at the same instant of time. This will be counted as one parallel step irrespective of the number of smaller steps initiated.
     
- Teams have to submit a report at the time of the competition which will contain a detailed description of each of the steps and energy conversions in the arrangement. Teams are encouraged to support their report with indicative diagrams.
     
- All the materials required for the arrangement should be brought by the corresponding team. Teams are not allowed to share any material. No material will be provided by the organizers.
     
- Contestants are responsible for removing their arrangement and any debris left after the completion of their 3 rounds.
     
- In case of any manual interventions during the run, points will be deducted and the team will have to go for the next run if there are more than 3 interventions.
     
- Judges decision will be final and binding!
 
- The organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.

            <content>
The recent failures of India’s power grid have not only forced more than 600 million people to survive without electricity – they’ve demonstrated the need for massive investments in clean technology and infrastructure. The emphasis on green technology is a product of the pricking question due to growing concerns about the environment.  The nitty-gritty of this event is to develop an idea for clean energy generation. 
With plenty of electricity problems in Southern states and opposition to other viable power sources by many players, it becomes clear that conventional, non-renewable energy is not the solution. This necessitates development of clean energy. If you think you have that little ‘spark’ that has ‘potential’ to solve a seemingly unsolvable issue at hand, this is for you.

Engineering is all about imagination and ingenuity. Rather than just theories and their application, it revolves around simpler domains such as indigenous thinking, common sense and elementary logic, all of which arise from the Supreme Intelligence, the "Pragyan" in us. Technology, as we know it today, is the manifestation of millennia of Pragyanic thought and action, which has unflinchingly served and enthralled mankind since the invention of the Wheel.
 
Pragyan, the annual Techno-Management festival of NIT, Trichy is a humble attempt to promote and foster this co-existential relationship between Man and Technology. The insignia, insinuating Man's eternally progressive leap over the Wheel of Technology, is symbolic of Pragyan’s endeavour to inculcate the spirit of engineering, innovation and forward thinking among the youth. For over half a decade, Pragyan has worked tirelessly towards this goal, by churning out several memorable editions, each of which has enlightened, emboldened and inspired an entire generation of engineers.

Problem Statement
 
- Pragyan 2013 is planned for Feb 28 - March 3, 2013 and will play host to a series of events and competitions which will be attended by a multitude of colleges throughout the country. To conduct an event of this scale, any college campus requires a variety of spaces which are used for a host of uses and functions which change over the duration of the event and based on the nature of the event as well. NIT Trichy's infrastructure for these events includes the Barn hall, the LHC, the EEE Audi, and the halls in the Admin block with the central ground. Other spaces such as the department classrooms and labs are used in conjunction with these to serve a wide range of events.

- Design the informal chill-out spot for Pragyan ‘13, a space for the informal conversations, the coffee breaks, for spending free time between events, or simply as a hang-out spot during those hot lazy afternoons. The area of this semi-open temporary structure should be around 1500 sqft (±200 sqft, or aptly justified otherwise) and should also include a platform that can double up as a stage for informal events, and display panels that will show the evolution of Pragyan over the years.

- Design this temporary structure exhibiting innovation in construction and the use of material, built with an attention to feasible construction with an approximate estimated cost not above Rs. 1 lakh as a highly functional chill-out zone and we will be pleased to construct the winning entry and put it up for the intended use this Pragyan.*

- Entries shall be evaluated on originality, feasibility, innovation and adherence to the context. Participants are expected to furnish their designs with conceptual drawings and sketches with details on the method of construction and how the building material is employed to achieve the structure designed, to aid the actual construction if and when the design is employed. Remember, we might actually be building this structure,* so clarity in terms of material use, joints, etc. is essential.

- Architecture and engineering students are welcome to enter this competition either individually or in groups, up to a maximum of three members per team.

- Three prizes will also be awarded with Rs. 25,000 to be won in cash apart from actually seeing your winning design come to life this Pragyan.* The deadline for submission is 10th February, 2013.

- To download the CAD drawing of the site and surrounding structures and the Pragyan logo, please visit http://www.pragyan.org/13/home/events/innovation/aakriti/.


*Please understand that it would be our pleasure to construct the winning project, but we reserve the right to not build the winning project (or to choose the project next in line) if any complications arise during the planning or execution stages, or otherwise.

“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”
                                                                             - Buckminster Fuller
 
We already know our civilization’s model is obsolete-so it’s time to put the thinking caps on. Pragyan 2013 invites you for some exciting Green Engineering. Enter the world of Building GREEN where aiming at evolving the most energy efficient, self-sustaining and economical Green Structure, the eco-minded of the country churns the realms of technology and creativity to produce magic.
 
The concept of Green Constructions has significantly evolved in the recent decades, and is advocated in every form feasible, with the growing demands for energy and resources. As power and materials get rarer and dearer, day by day, the future of construction clearly lies in self-sustainability.
 
With Green technology emerging as one of the niche areas of potential in the building scenario, Pragyan 2013 collaborating with IGBC takes pride in presenting our fellow eco-friends, B GREEN, the race to design the ultimate green building.

Problem Statement
 
- Build an autonomous line follower robot which would negotiate through obstacles, inversions and discontinuity and determine the correct path and navigate through a toll plaza. 
 
 
Arena Specification
 
Prelims:
 
- The arena will have a single track which is indicated by a line of width 3 cm. The designed track might consist of straight lines, smooth curves , sharp turns and discontinuities  the track is a black line on a white background .Discontinuities will not be more than 20cm. Obstacles (5cm x 5cm x 10cm painted white) will be placed on each track. The bot will have to evade the obstacles, cross the discontinuities and navigate till the IR LED checkpoint.
 
Finals:
 
- Here the bot has to retrace the path (mentioned above)till the check point (5cm X 5cm IR LED array placed 15 cm from the track and at 3-8 cm height). The bot will have to scan the three bit binary code from the card board(three boxes of specification 5cmx5cm each) that gives the toll booth number ,placed opposite to the LED checkpoint .The booths will be numbered starting from the left. After getting the input the bot has to navigate to the specified booth number and once it enters the booth the end of the circuit will be marked by discontinuity of 5cm  and a vertical strip of black line perpendicular to the direction of booth line. The bot has to park at this point and the same can be used for the indication of completion of track.
 
 
Sample Arena
 
- Please refer to the figure at the bottom of the page for the sample arena.


Dimensions and Fabrications
 
- The bot must fit within a square of dimensions 20cm x 20cm. There are no height constraints.
 
- The bot must sense the IR led checkpoint (3-8cm high) kept 15 cm from the track on the left side of the track.
 
- It should also scan the binary input kept 15cm from the track on the right side.
 
- Each machine must be stable and should be able to stand on its own at the beginning of the race when put in the start zone. Machines not fulfilling this criterion will be disqualified.
 
- During the run, the machine can expand itself provided it does not damage the arena in anyway. However, it is not allowed to leave anything behind or make any marks while traversing the arena. No machine can separate or split into two or more units. All machines found damaging the arena will be immediately disqualified.
 
- The teams are allowed to use readymade sensor kits. But use of Lego kits and any other readymade components is not allowed (readymade PCB for handling microcontrollers are not allowed).
 
 
Power Supply and Propulsion
 
- The bot must use an on-board power supply. No external power supply will be allowed.
 
- Each team shall prepare its own power supply for all its machines.
 
- The potential difference between any two points on any of the machines must not exceed 12 V DC.
  
 
Controls
 
- The bot must be completely autonomous.
 
- It should not receive any external help during the course of the run.

Event Rules
 
- All teams will be given a calibration time of 10 minutes.
 
- Maximum time given for one trial is 10 minutes.
 
- The starting procedure of the robot should be simple and should not involve giving the machine any manual force or impulse in any direction.
 
- Each bot is supposed to indicate with a suitable indicator (LED, Buzzer, etc.), clearly visible to the judges, when the bot has reached the check point. This indicator should be off at all other times. Any team unable to indicate this accurately will incur a penalty.
 
- Before each game begins, the participants should clearly describe how their robot detects the obstacles and indicates at the check point.
 
- Each team is allowed a maximum of 3 trials. All trials require the approval of the presiding judges before the machine can be removed from the arena. In each trial, the timer will be set back to zero.
 
- During a trial, the machine will have to be restarted by putting it back on the start zone. For a trial, the machine will have to be in Power Off mode and turned on again at the start zone on the signal of the judges.
 
- Between trials, participants may not feed information about the arena to the machine. However, participants are allowed to: Adjust sensors (Gain, Position etc.), Change speed settings and Make repairs. However, a participant may not alter a machine in a manner that alters its weight (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed). The judges shall arbitrate. The points earned by the team till that time will be retained.
 
- Participants will not be allowed to handle the obstacle positions on the track. Only event managers are allowed to handle the obstacles.
 
- Participants are not allowed to keep anything inside the arena other than the machine.
 
- The judges may stop any robot at any time if they feel that it is performing, or is about to perform, any action that is dangerous or hazardous to people or equipment. No robot is allowed to use any flammable, combustible, explosive or potentially dangerous processes.
 
- Readymade sensors (eg. line array sensors) could be used.
  
 
Team Composition:
 
- Maximum of 4 participants per team.
 
- Teams should register themselves online.
 
- No person shall be a member of two teams.
 
- Maximum of ten teams will be shortlisted for the finals.

The Arena

- Please refer to the figure at the bottom of the page for the arena. 
 
NOTE:
- The three colored circles represent the three denominations which will be specified soon. These three colors are fixed. Their positions in the arena will be random.
 
- The black square represents the deposition zone and it is also the start zone.
 
- This image is just to provide an idea as to how the arena will look like. Actual images of the arena taken from the overhead camera will be similar to the above image and will be uploaded by the end of next week. 
 
- It will be a 2mx2m arena printed on a flex sheet. At one corner is the depositing zone and the other is the start zones. Coloured circles (Red,Yellow,Cyan) with a diameter of 25cm will be placed randomly on the arena as shown in the figure. Each of the colour represents a denomination of the currency.
  
 
The Task
 
- The teams will be given a text file just before start.
 
- The text file will indicate the exact amount to be robbed.
 
- Based on that the robot will have to navigate to the various colours depending on the denomination.
 
- Navigating to and standing over one coloured circle represents collecting one note of that particular denomination. The bot can collect a maximum of two notes(and both of them have to be of different denominations) after which the bot must go back to the deposition zone before collecting another note.
 
- For example if the red circle stands for Rs. 100, cyan for Rs. 50, and yellow for Rs. 10 and the amount specified by the text file is Rs. 170, then the robot must follow the following directions:
Start zone-&gt; go and stand over Red circle-&gt;go and stand over cyan circle-&gt;Deposition zone -&gt; to the yellow circle-&gt;Deposition zone-&gt;yellow circle again-&gt;Deposition zone.
 
- The order of collecting the notes is immaterial.
 
- 15 minutes of calibration time and 10 minutes of run time will be given to all the teams. The teams can ask for any number of resets during the 10 minutes runtie, but the time won't be stopped.
 
  
Scoring
 
- SCORE=1000-A-B-C
 
where, A is the deficit amount not collected by the robot. For eg. If the given task was for Rs 100 and the bot collected Rs 60 then A=40; 
B=2*extra amount collected by the bot; 
C=100*(Number of times the bot violates the clause mentioned in point 4 of THE TASK). 
 
- If there is a tie in the scores, then the robot with least number of violations and the time taken to accumulate the amount will be considered. 
 
 
Robot Specifications
 
- The dimensions should not exceed 25x25x25cm.
 
- It should be fully autonomous.
 
- It may or may not be wired and if wired, wires of sufficient length should be used to prevent the wire from the laptop to the bot from slacking.
 
- The power supply must be  on board and the voltage between any two points must not exceed 12V.
 
- Arduino and its clones are allowed. However, other readymade microcontroller boards purchased as a part of kits are not allowed. If a team has printed their own development board PCB, then a schematic and layout of the board has to be submitted to the event managers before the event.
 
- If boards have been self-designed and printed, hard copy of the design must be submitted to the organisers before the start of the competition.
 
- Any bots which are found to be damaging the arena will be disqualified immediately.
 
- If a team is getting any of their Microcontroller Boards or other electronic stuff printed on PCBs, the layouts and Schematics of the boards must be submitted to the organisers beforehand.

Criteria for Victory 
 
- A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized.
 
- A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display controlled motion. A bot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement. This rule will also apply to any robot that becomes trapped by any part of the arena or arena hazards.
 
- In case both the robots remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be decided subjectively.
 
- A robot that is deemed unsafe by the judges after the match has begun will be disqualified and therefore declared the loser. The match will be immediately halted and the opponent will be awarded a win.
 
- If a robot is thrown out of the arena the match will stop immediately, and the robot still inside the arena will automatically be declared as the winner.
 
- Robots can not win by pinning or lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow pinning or lifting for a maximum of 20 seconds per pin/lift then the robots will be instructed the attacker to release. If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker is able to release but does not, their robot may be disqualified. If two or more robots become entangled or a crushing or gripping weapon is employed and becomes trapped within another robot, then the competitors should make the timekeeper aware, the fight  should be stopped and the robots separated by the safest means.
 
- Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage and control:
 
	- Aggression: Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness and effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.
 
	- Control: Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its weapons in the most effective way, avoid Arena Hazards, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its weapons.
 
	- Damage: Through deliberate action, a robot either directly, or indirectly using the Arena Hazards, reduces the functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an opponent. Damage is not considered relevant if a robot inadvertently harms itself. Also, if a pressure vessel or a rapidly spinning device on a robot fragments, any damage to the opponent will not be considered "deliberate".

            <content>
Safety Rules
 
- Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing
 
- Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries and pneumatics, robot without proper protection will not be allowed to compete.
 
- If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers. Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.
 
- Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.
 
- Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with expressed consent of the event coordinators.
 
- All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care to not hurt yourself or others when building, testing and competing.
 
- All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges. to the surroundings during the stay of the teams in the competition area should not be carried out without the consent of organizers. Not following this rule may result in disqualification.
 
- All the resources provided at the time of competition from the organizers should be strictly used only after the consent of the organizers.
 
- Once the robots have entered into the arena, no team members can enter into the arena at any point of time. In case if fight has to be halted in between and some changes have to be done in the arena or condition of the robot(s), it will be done by organizers only.

- The electric voltage between 2 points anywhere in the machine should not be more than 36 V DC at any point of time.
 
- All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire,failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.
 
- Use of damaged, non-leak proof batteries may lead to disqualification.
 
- Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries.
 
- Change of battery will not be allowed during the match.
 
- One 220V power socket will be provided for each team.
 
 
Pneumatics
 
- Robot can use pressurized non-inflammable gases to actuate pneumatic devices. Maximum allowed outlet nozzle pressure is 8 bar. The storage tank and pressure regulators used by teams need to be certified and teams using pneumatics are required to produce the Safety and Security letters at the Registration Desk at the venue. Failing to do so will lead to direct disqualification.
 
- Participants must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauge. Also there should be provision to check the cylinder pressure on the bot.
 
- The maximum pressure in cylinder should not exceed the rated pressure at any point of time.
 
- You must have a safe way of refilling the system and determining the on board pressure.
 
- All pneumatic components on board a robot must be securely mounted. Care must be taken while mounting the pressure vessel and armour to ensure that if ruptured it will not escape the robot. The terms 'pressure vessel, bottle, and source tank' are used interchangeably.

Years ago the great hero Rama led an expedition to the mystical land of Sri Lanka, to rescue his wife Sita from the clutches of the daemon king Ravana. On their way they faced a great conundrum of crossing the vast Indian Ocean. Rama along with his army built a floating bridge across the ocean, the famous Ram Setu. We are all aware of the epic battle that took place between daemon king Ravana and Rama, resulting in Ravana’s defeat and salvage of Sita. We at Pragyan’13 give you an opportunity in rebuilding Ram Setu.

- Each team has to make a manual robot capable of picking and placing tennis balls.
 
- A team may consist of maximum four members.
 
- The arena is divided in to 3 regions layer 0, layer 1 and layer 2.
 
- The robot will start from layer 0 where it will be put on a red square 40x40 cm2.
 
- The boulder region on layer 0 will have 12 balls. The robot can pick as many balls as it can.
 
- The robot has to climb a slope of 10 degress to reach layer 1.
 
- Layer 1 will be an 80x80 platform.
 
- Layer 1 and layer 2 will have a void bridge connecting them approximately 21 cm long.
 
- The bridge will have 12 sockets on them for the boulders.
 
- The robot has to drop the balls in to each of the slots.
 
- The bridge will be completed only if all the 12 balls have been dropped in to the slots.
 
- After the bridge is made the robot has cross it and get the final ball (resembling sita) and bring it back to layer 0. Where it has to be put on top of the pedestal to complete the event.
 
- The arena for the final round will be slightly modified
 
 
Arena

- Please refer to Figure 2 at the bottom of the page.
 
Dimensions
 
- Please refer to Figure 3 and Figure 4 at the bottom of the page.
 
After dropping the balls:

- Please refer to Figure 5 and Figure 6 at the bottom of the page.
 
Red Ball
 
- Please refer to Figure 6 at the bottom of the page. 
 
  
Scoring:
 
- +20 for successfully placing each ball into the slot.
 
- +10 For each additional ball picked up. If robot picks up two or more balls simultaneously from the boulder region
 
- -5 if the ball is dropped during transit, on or after the 100 slope
 
- -5 if the ball misses the slot and falls outside the arena
 
- +30 for crossing the bridge.
 
- +40 for getting the final ball and putting it on the pedestal at level zero.
 
- Final score = total score + time left in seconds.
 
  
Game rules:
 
- Each team can have maximum 3 trials.
 
- Each round will be of 15 min.
 
- The team will lose a trial if the bot malfunctions during that trial.
 
- The team is not allowed to touch the bot or arena during a trial, doing so will lead to termination of the trial.
 
- If the ball misses the bridge slot and falls outside, the ball will be put back to the boulder region.
 
- The bot can only cross the bridge after putting all the 12 balls into the slot.
 
- The best of the three trials will be considered for the final scoring.
 
- No points will be deducted, if the bot drops the ball, after picking it up completely or partially, in the boulder region. However, if the bot drops the balls on or after the slope, then negative points will be awarded, and the ball will be placed back in the boulder region.

Q1. Is it ok if more than 1 team participates from the same college?
 
Yes, it is completely fine for any number of teams to participate from the same college. However, in case judges feel that any two teams have copied the bot design from each other, both teams will be disqualified.

Any number of people can be involved in making the bot. However, participation certificates, when awarded, will be given only to four members per bot.

No. A valid photo identity proof, the student identity card, is sufficient. No bonafide is required

Any power source, is fine. However, potential difference between any two points, cannot exceed 12V DC, at any time during the run. 
 
Q5. What is the weight of the bot that is allowed?
 
There is no limitation on the weight of the bot, as long as it doesn't damage the arena
 
Q6. Are readymade dev-boards allowed?
 
Ready made dev boards, are accepted(Incl. Arduino).
 
Q7. Are ready-made grippers allowed?
 
The mechanism as such, must not be ready-made. Only the 'gripper', can be ready made. Gears etc can be purchased. But the assemblage as such must not be ready made. It is upto judges discretion to decide, if the mechanism is something you have actually put your effort into, or is it just an assembly job.

Labyrinth brings to you a series of puzzles, an enthralling treasure hunt of sorts. It is a quest that tests your code-cracking, brainstorming and lateral thinking, while subtly nudging your innate capacity to think outside the box. This Pragyan, experience thrills at par with being in an Indiana Jones adventure. Prepare yourself for twists and turns; tune your eyes and mind to spot the black cat in the dark room.
 
Labyrinth is a furious race that pushes its participants to the extreme of their abilities, urging them to delve deeper and unravel each layer of mystery as quickly as possible.  The race ends during Pragyan, when the most compelling levels of the event seek out only the worthy. This hunt promises to be an adrenaline packed race with contenders fighting to reach the end of the rainbow before the rest and claim the pot of gold that is rightfully theirs.

- This single stage multi-level event (40 - 50 levels) will serve as a run up to Pragyan, climaxing on the days of Pragyan 2013.
 
- This event will contain stages of varying difficulty levels, some more, some less challenging, with a beginner friendly learning curve.
 
- For all those who start it now; this will not be one of those riddles where you click through in some minutes. It will take you some levels to get a feeling of it, and you should be addicted when you get there.
 
- If you just are stuck, you might get some hints after trying for hours. Nothing wrong about them, they hardly take anything away from the satisfaction you get from solving a riddle; also you can be sure to learn a lot from all those riddles, if you solve them properly.

- Every level has an answer or a method that would take you to the next level. Try all to get to the next  level; don't be limited to the picture or to the browser.
 
- The answer of a particular level gives you access to the next level.
 
- All answers are lower-case letters and numbers 0-9. Spaces, special characters are not allowed.
 
- Write down all usernames and passwords, and don't forget to bookmark your last level.
 
- Make up your mind about source codes. You may find something useful in the master plan of the page.
 
- Most important, don't limit yourself to the mouse. You have a keyboard, you have other programs on your computer, you have internet (to search and download stuff).
 
- Please try not to refresh the page. Refreshing pages where you submitted wrong answers would increase our record of your number of attempts.
 
- If you leave labyrinth midway, and come back to it later, you will be taken to the level where you left off.
 
- However, the amount of time you took for the game is calculated from the time you started playing, and is not the time you spent on the web site.

For an unsolved problem no time consumed is computed.
 
- There is no partial credit for any problem.
 
- After running a program against our test data, the judge produces a status message. This is also output to the user.
 
- List of languages allowed: C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python, Haskell, Clojure and Scala.

Are you a FOSS enthusiast?
Do you love the terminal?
This event is just for you!
 
We're guessing that you're familiar with the shell.  For those without a clue, let's simply say Shell is where all those Linux Commands are typed out. The Shell is powerful. Powerful enough to do anything. But then, how should `anything` be defined?

'Crack the Shell' is all about solving simple day to day tasks on your computer through the terminal.

The radical distinction of Crime Busters from other events is that it is purely non technical. It is for the fast paced minds but purely logical and brainy, sure to say brilliant. An event where NITTians as well as our honored guests can come to blow off steam, away from all the robotics and brain cracking coding. With immense lateral thinking involved, Crime Busters is uncomplicated but not to be reckoned easy.
